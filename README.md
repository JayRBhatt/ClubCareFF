## INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT

1.1 PROJECT SUMMARY

This project provides an effortless interface and functioning to one of the most tedious tasks
for most institutes - Club Management! The project delivers the connection between the
Students/Members that belong to the club and to club's respective Moderators or
Coordinators. The final step in the project, completed in late April-2022, demonstrated the
ability to deliver the major prospect of the project, that being bridging the gap between the
club members and the Coordinators/Decision makers of the Club by bringing forward
features notifying the members or generating and displaying events of the specific clubs or
general.

1.2 PURPOSE

The principal purpose of the project is to serve an institution and various stakeholders with
flawless furnished websites with most user-friendly GUI with the functionality to ease the
offline management of the Club. The participants of the project include the assigned
coordinators, already a member, member to be, and a central authority(administrator). The
project is made in such a manner that it also makes it easy for future enhancements on the
website for the respective developers.

1.3 OBJECTIVE

To provide the above goals or purpose of the project, various objectives were set by the team.

1.3.1 Cost

Reducing the cost of basic entities and replacing it by automating the basic processes that
required labor.

1.3.2 Efficiency

Getting more output for a unit of input, that being the usage of the functions on the website
should be able to perform its functionality it is meant to match.

1.3.3 User Experience
To enhance the user experience so as to allow functionality to any users(Layman or Expert at
systems). The interaction between the user and the website must be effortless so as to make it
more appealing to the user. Thus more the ease in handling website, more satisfaction to the
users for using the website.

1.3.4 Data management	

Data management is the base of the club management i.e. if the data is managed well, then
managing a club won’t be a big of a problem as it’s all about maneuvering the data around.

1.3.5 Integration

Integrating various aspects of a data handling website is the key to fulfill the purposes
mentioned above.

1.4 SCOPE

This project delivers a brand new website which procures all the hassle of the management of
the club on papers. The design of the website is consistent throughout and is made in such a
way that it is easy for a new user of the system to use it for one's use. The

1.5 PROJECT PLANNING

The first step to developing the project like this is to plan it thoroughly then execute it
likewise. There exists various factors on which the planning of this project relied upon and
they are mentioned below:

1.5.1 Approaches

The approach that the team decided to pursue for the development of the project is Agile
Project development. The Agile Project Management Process is a value-centered method[5] of
project management that allows projects to get processed in small phases or cycles. The
methodology is one that is extremely flexible and projects that exhibit dynamic traits would
benefit from this process.

Each milestone of the project is treated as a "Sprints" and the goal being continuously
adaptive to the abrupt changes in the features of the website. As it is best suited for small
software projects made up of a highly collaborative team or a project that requires frequent
iteration, this approach became the primary choice for the development.

Agile aspects:

-Flexibility: The scope of work may change according to new requirements.
-Work breakdown: The project consists of small cycles (known as Sprints in Scrum).
-Value of teamwork: The team members work closely together and have a clear vision
of their responsibilities.
-Iterative improvements: There is frequent reassessment of the work done within a
cycle to make the final product better.
-Cooperation with a client: A customer is closely engaged in the development and can
change the requirements or accept the team’s suggestions. Here although there existed
a customer as such but the ideas of various members were considered to be that of
clients and were satisfied in much simpler aspects.

The mentioned methodology is too general when it depicts an "Agile development", therefore
a prospect of agile development named XP Programming was used for the development
model.Extreme Programming (XP) differs from the other frameworks by its focus on
technical aspects of software development, namely quality code. XP is used by 9 percent of
companies.

It combines the most essential, providing Agile teams with a number of tools to optimize the
engineering process. Extreme Programming is a set of certain practices, applied to software
engineering in order to improve its quality and ability to adapt to the changing requirements.
XP requires developers to perform a little number of engineering practices on the highest,
almost extreme level possible, hence the name.

The most commonly used XP practices are:
-test-driven development (TDD),
-code refactoring,
-continuous integration,
-pair programming, and
-coding standards.3

1.5.2 Effort and Time, Cost Estimation
The development of the project is made with the negligible cost due to usage of freely
available resources on the internet. The basic investment to the project is Knowledge, its
implementation and but obvious, time.
The efforts can be considered constant due to the time available to develop the project. The
team of 3 developers contributing all the time possible towards development and putting the
required efforts cannot be put into numbers when considering the scalability of the project
and the size of the team.
